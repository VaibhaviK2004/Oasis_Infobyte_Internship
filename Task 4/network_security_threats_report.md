Key Network Security Threats
============================
1.	Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) Attacks
--------------------------------------------------------------
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a way for cybercriminals to make a website or online service stop working for regular users. They do this by sending a huge number of fake requests to the server—much more than it can handle. When a website gets too many requests at once, it slows down or even crashes, so normal people can’t use it.
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is even more dangerous. Instead of one computer sending fake requests, hundreds or thousands of computers (often infected by malware and controlled by the attacker as a “botnet”) all work together to flood the target, making it much harder to block the attack.
How Does a DoS Attack Work?
•	An attacker finds a weakness in a website or service. It could be anything, like a search bar or login page.
•	They use software to quickly send lots of requests, making that part of the site busy or even crash.
•	In a DDoS attack, the attacker uses many infected computers worldwide to send requests at the same time.
Real-World Example
Imagine a shop where the doors get crowded with people who aren’t actually buying anything. The real customers cannot get inside. That’s what happens during a DoS or DDoS attack—real users get blocked because the system is too busy with fake traffic.
For instance, in 2020, huge botnets attacked websites, including big companies like Amazon, so normal users couldn’t access their services for hours.
Impact
•	The website or app stops working, leading to angry customers and lost trust.
•	Companies lose money when customers can’t buy or use their services.
•	Reputation damage if online services go down often.
How to Prevent DoS and DDoS Attacks
•	Make sure websites and apps are designed to handle lots of traffic and can ignore suspicious requests.
•	Use special security systems called firewalls that can block bad traffic.
•	Use rate limits—only allow a certain number of requests per user each minute.
•	Continuously monitor your network, so you can spot an attack early and act fast.
•	Have an emergency plan, so everyone knows what to do if an attack happens.
By understanding DoS and DDoS attacks and taking steps to prepare and protect your systems, organizations can keep their services available for real users and maintain trust with their customers.

2.	Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
------------------------------------
A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is when a hacker secretly gets in between two people or systems who are trying to talk to each other. The hacker listens to the conversation, steals information, and can even change what is being shared—all without either person realizing someone is in the middle.
How Does a MitM Attack Work?
Attackers can use several tricks:
•	They set up fake Wi-Fi networks in public places. When people connect, all their activity goes through the hacker’s system.
•	They make fake websites or login pages that look real, so people enter their usernames and passwords, which the hacker then collects.
•	Sometimes, attackers use phishing emails to get users to click on a bad link, sending their private information directly to the hacker.
Real-World Example
A famous hacking group, Lapsus$, tricked users in 2022 by creating a fake Office 365 login page. Over 10,000 people entered their usernames and passwords, believing the website was real, but all this information went straight to the hackers. They even got past extra security (multi-factor authentication) using information they stole.
Impact
•	Attackers can steal login details (usernames and passwords).
•	They can read or change sensitive communications and emails.
•	Businesses can lose money if hackers get into company systems.
•	Private data, including bank info or business secrets, might be leaked.
How to Stay Safe from MitM Attacks
•	Always check that web addresses (URLs) are correct before logging in.
•	Only use websites that begin with “https://”, which means the data is encrypted and harder to intercept.
•	Don’t connect to free, public Wi-Fi for anything important, especially banking or work.
•	Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) so even if someone steals your password, they can’t log in easily.
•	Learn to recognize fake websites and phishing attempts—be careful about links in emails and pop-ups.
By following these tips, it gets much harder for hackers to get between you and your private information, helping you stay secure online.

3. Spoofing Attacks (including Phishing, DNS Spoofing)
------------------------------------------------------
Spoofing attacks happen when hackers pretend to be someone or something you trust to steal your information or harm your devices. They fake their identity to trick you into giving them access or clicking on dangerous links.
How Spoofing Works
•	Phishing Emails: Attackers send emails that look like they're from someone you know, but they contain harmful links or attachments. They may use email addresses that look almost real by changing a letter or number.
•	DNS Spoofing: Hackers change the address where a website points so when you try to visit a real site, you end up on a fake one designed to steal your information.
•	ARP Spoofing: Attackers fool devices on a local network into sending data to them instead of the right place, allowing them to intercept and change the data.
Real-World Example
DNS spoofing can send you to a fake website that looks real, so you enter passwords or credit card details, which the attacker then steals. This leads to more serious problems like identity theft or malware infections.
Impact of Spoofing Attacks
•	Hackers can steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information.
•	Spoofing can cause financial fraud or allow attackers to break into company systems.
•	Users’ trust is damaged due to these security breaches.
How to Protect Yourself and Your Network
•	Use strong email filters to block suspicious messages before they reach you.
•	Check and validate internet security certificates and DNS records to make sure websites are genuine.
•	Regularly train yourself and others to recognize spoofing attempts and avoid risky actions like clicking unknown links.
By staying cautious and using good security habits, spoofing attacks can be detected early or avoided altogether, keeping your data and devices safe.
